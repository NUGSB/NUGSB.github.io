Title:  The granular economy of Kazakhstan
Abstract: This paper analyzes the importance of idiosyncratic firm specific shocks for explaining macroeconomic  fluctuations in an emerging economy. To this end, we use detailed quarterly firm level data to document that the  firm size distribution is fat-tailed and that idiosyncratic shocks of the largest 30 firms appear to explain  nearly 80% of the growth in aggregate total factor productivity. This confirms earlier research for the U.S. of  the "granular hypothesis" (Gabaix, 2011). Thus individual firm shocks do not average out in the aggregate as is  assumed in most of the macroeconomic literature, instead, macroeconomic questions can be answered by analyzing the  behavior of the largest firms.
