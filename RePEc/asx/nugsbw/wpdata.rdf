Title: Price-cost margins, fixed costs and excess profits 
Abstract: This paper provides a new method to estimate price-cost margins in the presence of fixed costs of production. By exploiting properties of the primal and dual sales-based and cost-based Solow residuals, we are able to simultaneously estimate price-cost margins and the share of fixed costs in total costs for each input. Ignoring fixed costs in production underestimates price-cost margins and overestimates excess profit shares. Using a 30 year panel of Belgian firms we estimate price-cost margins, as a fraction of sales, of 25.4% on average, which can be decomposed between fixed costs of 22.9% and excess profits of 2.5%. Belgian price-cost margins have declined (-5.9%) in the past three decades due to a combination of falling fixed costs (-4.0%) and decreasing excess profits (-1.9%), suggesting output markets have become even more competitive over time. While large firms have higher profit shares than small firms, they have lower fixed cost shares as well as lower price-cost margins.

Title: Firm employment dynamics in Kazakhstan after sudden Russian immigration 
Abstract: Kazakhstan was the top destination country for Russian immigrants in 2022, a year when Russian emigration sharply increased due to new international sanctions and war mobilization. The circumstances offer a rare opportunity to explore how a large sudden skill-abundant immigration within an economic union affects firm employment dynamics for a middle-income receiving country. Kazakhstan and Russia share the world's longest continuous land border, so immigration effects are regionally dispersed rather than concentrated solely in cities, and Kazakhstan offers business registers data to explore firm-level employment dynamics. Absent fine regional data on immigration flows, our empirical approach uses a pre-war share of the Russian population in 215 districts of Kazakhstan as a reduced-form instrument for the treatment of Russian immigration. We find no pre-war trends in firm employment growth related to the Russian district population shares. Using difference-in-differences estimation, we find large effects of 2022 Russian immigration on the employment growth for Kazakhstan's incumbent firms in more affected regions. The employment growth is larger for small firms, young foreign-owned firms, older domestic firms, and ICT firms, and results are robust to the exclusion or inclusion of Kazakhstan's two major cities of Almaty and Astana. We estimate that Kazakhstan's regions, excluding the two major cities, would have experienced a private sector employment fall of 86,500 in 2022 rather than the actual increase of 21,500 if Russian immigration flows had not occurred.

Title: Foreign-owned firms and occupational gender pay inequality
Abstract: Despite significant progress in gender equality over the past decades, women's access to equal pay is still a persistent and complex issue. Recent research on the gender pay gap in foreign-owned companies has illuminated the possible effects of foreign ownership on the gender wage gap, emphasizing the significance of addressing this problem for advancing gender equality in the context of global trade and economic growth. This paper examines the gender pay gap in Kazakhstan, with a focus on the impact of foreign ownership and the
gender-occupational composition of firms. The study aims to identify the underlying sources of the gender pay gap and whether it can be attributed to either wage discrimination or productivity differences, and how the institutional background of Kazakhstan may influence this issue. Our primary estimation technique throughout the analysis is the reduced-form linear probability model. We show that the gender pay gap is higher in foreign-owned firms, especially for managerial positions. Interestingly, our findings align with distinct sources of the disparity in foreign-owned firms and domestic firms. For foreign-owned firms, we find a gender wage gap only in management positions, consistent with a wage gap driven by work requirements that disproportionately impact women in career advancement. For domestic-owned firms, we find a rural versus urban difference in the
gender wage gap which indicates discrimination based on traditional gender stereotypes. We do not find any evidence to suggest that the wage disparity is due to productivity differences. Based on our findings, policy measures should include flexible work arrangements that enhance temporal flexibility to reduce the gender pay
gap and improve outcomes for female employees.

Title: Dual Process Intuitions: Consumers' Beliefs about Persuasion Processing Drive Morality of Marketing Communications
Abstract: Consumers tend to dislike companies that use immoral marketing persuasion tactics. How do consumers decide what persuasion is morally acceptable and what persuasion is not? Three studies show that morality of marketing persuasion depends on consumers' beliefs about information processing - Dual Process Intuitions. If consumers think persuasion aims at emotions and intuition - bypassing deliberative reasoning - they will evaluate it as more immoral and manipulative than persuasion believed to be processed deliberately. This is because consumers find system 1 processing (fast and effortless; e.g., encountering fear appeal ad) more automatic than system 2 processing (slow and effortful; e.g., reading about a product). Since system 2 (rather than system 1) persuasion is considered less immoral, it yields greater positive attitude change than that of system 1. These findings contribute to the literature on lay theories about persuasion, beliefs about information processing, and morality in marketing. Practitioners may use these results to better tailor their persuasion messages, especially if their customers are usually sensitive to persuasion - by creating the perception of autonomous choice using system 2 persuasion.

Title:  The Impact of Firm-level Covid Rescue Policies on Productivity Growth and Reallocation
Abstract: We analyze the impact of Covid-19 rescue policies on both firm-level and aggregate productivity growth and reallocation. Using administrative data on the universe of firms' subsidies in Flanders, we estimate the causal impact of these subsidies on firm-level outcomes. Firms that received subsidies saw a 7% increase in productivity, compared to firms that applied for, but did not obtain subsidies. Furthermore, the propensity to exit the market was 43% lower for treated firms. Aggregate productivity growth, a share-weighted sum of firms' productivity evolutions, amounted to 6% in 2020. While within-firm productivity growth was similar for both subsidized and non-subsidized firms, there is a reallocation of market shares from subsidized firms to non-subsidized firms. These results suggest that Covid rescue policies helped firms to sustain and preserve productivity, while not obstructing allocative efficiency gains to non-subsidized firms.

Title:  How binding is supervisory guidance? Evidence from the European calendar provisioning
Abstract: We examine whether banks respond differently to the adoption of a supervisory guidance as compared to a similar regulatory action. By exploiting the staggered and distinct supervisory and regulatory implementation of the European Calendar Provision, we indeed document that while this reform achieved the intended overall goal of reducing European banks' nonperforming loans ratios, its effect materialized during the initial release of the ECB supervisory guidance, rather than following its adoption as a Pillar 1 regulation. That is, the subsequent formalization of this supervisory initiative within a regulatory framework achieved limited economic results, while eliminating any residual flexibility for the regulatory authority concerning the degree to which the calendar provisioning should be enforced.

Title:  Mountains of Evidence: The Effects of Abnormal Air Pollution on Crime
Abstract: This is the first study to assess that air pollution increases criminal activity in a city with air pollution regularly exceeding international safety standards. For winter in Almaty, Kazakhstan, we collect data on crime and PM2.5 pollution across city districts over 8-hour intervals. Our identification strategy employs distinctive features of Almaty's geography: the proximity of some districts to mountain winds and the high frequency of temperature inversions. Using a PPML control function approach, we estimate a PM2.5 elasticity of the expected crime rate equal to 0.38, more than four times as large as elasticity estimates from studies of cleaner cities. Our data and empirical setting also facilitate our identification of air pollution effects on particular crime types. We find that air pollution increases robbery and high-stakes property crime more than low-stakes property crime. These new results support the theory that air pollution induces disregard for criminal consequences and bring further evidence that air pollution induces aggression.

Title:  Wage dispersion and firm performance: evidence from Kazakhstan
Abstract: This paper studies within-firm pay inequality and its impact on firm performance in Kazakhstan. We measure within-firm pay inequality as the wage differential between the top- and the bottom-level job occupations. First, we report that wage inequality is higher in larger firms. This finding is consistent with the theories of differentiated pay schemes and the scope of control. Further, we explore to what extent a rise in firm inequality affects firm performance. Although a higher wage dispersion may serve as a signal to attract more productive or talented workers, we find no evidence to support the idea that incentive-based pay can boost overall firm performance. The negative impact points to rent extraction by top job occupations.

Title:  M&A and Cybersecurity Risk: Empirical Evidence
Abstract: Using text-based measures of cybersecurity risk, we document that low cybersecurity risk firms are more likely to initiate or be targeted for an M&A transaction. Further, we show that the market has recently started to price cybersecurity risk at the time of a deal announcement and – consistent with this finding - attempted mergers are significantly less likely to fail if the selected target has a low cybersecurity risk profile. Cyber risk is finally reflected in merger premium, which appears to be systematically higher for mergers where the acquirer exhibits low cybersecurity risk levels. These findings offer novel evidence on the economic impact of cybersecurity risk on the market for corporate control.

Title:  The granular economy of Kazakhstan
Abstract: This paper analyzes the importance of idiosyncratic firm specific shocks for explaining macroeconomic  fluctuations in an emerging economy. To this end, we use detailed quarterly firm level data to document that the  firm size distribution is fat-tailed and that idiosyncratic shocks of the largest 30 firms appear to explain  nearly 80% of the growth in aggregate total factor productivity. This confirms earlier research for the U.S. of  the "granular hypothesis" (Gabaix, 2011). Thus individual firm shocks do not average out in the aggregate as is  assumed in most of the macroeconomic literature, instead, macroeconomic questions can be answered by analyzing the  behavior of the largest firms.
